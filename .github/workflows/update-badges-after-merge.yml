# This workflow updates status badges for coverage, Docker build, and tests after every manual trigger.
# It runs in multiple jobs: initializes badges as failing, runs coverage, Docker build, and tests in parallel, and finally pushes the updated badges.
# Artifacts are used to pass badge files between jobs, with a 7-day retention for debugging.
